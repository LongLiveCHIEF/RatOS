# BIGTREETECH EBB42 v1.1

:::danger This board can be dangerous
When this board boots into DFU mode (which happens during firmware updates), the heater pin will be set to high, meaning your hotend will heat up for the duration of the firmware update process.
For this reason automatic firmware updates is disabled by default for the BTT EBB v1.1 boards in RatOS. You'll have to flash it through the [RatOS Configurator](http://RatOS.local/configure?step=2) when needed.
See page 14 and 15 in the [BTT EBB v1.1 manual](<https://github.com/bigtreetech/EBB/raw/master/EBB%20CAN%20V1.1%20(STM32G0B1)/EBB42%20CAN%20V1.1/BIGTREETECH%20EBB42%20CAN%20V1.1%20User%20Manual.pdf>)

:::caution Use a good quality cable
Make sure your board is connected to the Pi via a good quality USB 3.1 (or better) braided cable for best performance and durability.

## Firmware installation

Follow the steps in the RatOS Configurator at [http://RatOS.local/configure?step=2](http://RatOS.local/configure?step=2).

## I updated klipper and now i get an error!

When you update klipper you might see an error that looks like this:

![Firmware version mismatch between host and guest](/img/firmware_version_mismatch.png)

This is because klipper made changes to a part of the MCU firmware that we use, and something went wrong while automatically flashing your board. Klipper is telling us that the version of klipper running on the Pi is newer than the version running on the MCU. To fix this, we have to flash the board with a new version of the firmware, Follow the steps in the RatOS Configurator at [http://RatOS.local/configure?step=2](http://RatOS.local/configure?step=2).
